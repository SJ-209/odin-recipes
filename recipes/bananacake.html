            <li>3 large free-range eggs</li>
            <li>100g/3½oz soft light brown sugar</li>

            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and grease and line a 900g/2lb loaf tin with baking parchment or use a loaf tin liner.</li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>Peel the bananas and mash with a fork. Tip into a large mixing bowl and add the eggs, sugar and oil. Use a fork or whisk to combine.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Add the flour, spice and baking powder and whisk together until thoroughly combined. Pour into the prepared tin. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the cake is well risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <li>Cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Serve warm or cold in slices. Spread with butter if you like.</li>
